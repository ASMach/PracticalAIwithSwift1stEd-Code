# PracticalAIwithSwift1stEd-Code
Code for the book's first edition.

| Directory | App | Chapter | Notes |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
|Chapter06-ImageClassifier | ✅ | ✅ | Chapter needs theory at end, and maybe roll in Object Detection |
|Chapter07-ActivityClassifier | ✴️ | ⛔️ | Being made by Mars (Speech Synthesis to say classifications?) |
|Chapter08-SoundClassifier | ✅ | ✅ | Chapter needs theory at end, and app needs functionality to request permission to record (init request and plist values), needs constraints adjustment on tiles |
|Chapter09-SentimentAnalyser | ✅ | ✅ | Needs theory at end |
|Chapter10-ImageComparer | ✅ | ⛔️ | Completed by Mars, pending bug fixes (**SwiftUI Issues: Text() resizing on binding change, Image() views ignore aspectRatio() setting**) |
|Chapter11-StyleTransferer | ✅ | ✴️ | Chapter in Progress with Paris; model in Progress with Paris |
|Chapter12-ObjectDetector | ⛔️ | ⛔️ | To be made by Paris, roll in face detection or make separate example for that? |
|Chapter13-Recommender| ⛔️ | ⛔️ | To be made by Mars |
|Chapter14-DrawingDetector | ⛔️ | ⛔️ | To be made by Mars (if she has time). [Turi Info](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/drawing_classifier/) Paris thoughts: use the image scanner thing that the camera supports to get a grayscale bitmap to infer from! |
|Chapter15-SpeechRecognizer | ✅ | ✅ | Chapter needs extension into training custom models/augmenting with domain-specific terminology  |
|Chapter16-SwiftForTensorflow | ✴️ | ⛔️ | Being made by Paris |
| ? (coremltools Task) | - | - | - |
| ? (Apple NLP tools Task) | - | - | [Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/naturallanguage) imply that this can be combined with CreateML |
| ? (Retraining on device Task) | - | - | - |
